ALX MySQL Configuration and Backup

In this ALX project, I delved into the world of configuring database servers within a primary-replica model. My task was to set up and configure two servers, all generously provided by ALX, in a MySQL primary-replica arrangement. With this setup, I created a dummy database and developed a handy Bash script for the automated generation of database backups.

This project allowed me to grasp essential concepts in database management, including the primary-replica architecture, data redundancy, and automated backup procedures. It's an exciting step towards mastering database administration and ensuring data reliability and availability.
